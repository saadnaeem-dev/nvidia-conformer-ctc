Saud: Good Afternoon. This is Saud speaking. How may I help you?
Muhittin: Hello Saud. My name is Muhittin Yöndem and I’m calling because we have issues with our internet connection.
Saud: Okay, Sir. Could you please provide me with more details?
Muhittin: Sure. During the day our internet is fast but during the nights the connection is very bad. What could cause that?
Saud: This is because during the nights there is a lot more traffic.
Muhittin: What we should do in this case?
Saud: My suggestion is to send you a new router that will be more powerful.
Muhittin: This sounds great.
Saud: I will inform our technical team to visit you and implement the new router.
Muhittin: Okay.
Saud: Could you please provide me with your address, Mr. Yöndem?
Muhittin: It’s  Bahar street, Pendik  İstanbul.
Saud: Thank you. Would next Tuesday at 3 pm suit you?
Muhittin: Yes, it’s fine. I will be at home at that time.
Saud: Great. Thanks for your call, Mr. Yöndem.
Muhittin: Thank you for your time, Saud.
Saud: Have a nice day!
Muhittin: Thanks. Bye.
Saud: Bye.
